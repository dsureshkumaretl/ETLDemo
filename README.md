1 Introduction
==================
This project is designed to evaluate the learning objectives of the Database and Analytics Programming
module as outlined below:
LO1: Analyse, compare, contrast and critically evaluate the characteristics of programming languages,
programming environments and database systems commonly utilised for data analytics solution
implementation.
LO2: Critically assess the challenges associated with processing big data datasets and compare and contrast
programming for big data vis-Ã -vis programming for conventional datasets.
LO3: Evaluate tools and techniques for managing the data pipeline and preparing data for further analysis
through data wrangling, cleaning, and validation.
LO4: Critically assess methods and practices for software development in order to design and implement
data programming requirements.
LO5: Evaluate, design and implement solutions for processing datasets by using key programming patterns
and constructs for data analytics, relevant programming languages, and suitable database systems.
2 Objectives
====================
The objective of this project is to identify and carry out a series of analyses on a collection of large datasets
that are somehow related or complement each other, utilising appropriate programming languages,
programming environments and database systems.
This project is a team project. Teams will have a maximum of 3 members.
Your project must incorporate the following elements:
1. A minimum of two datasets should be used, of which at least one should be semi-structured. For
teams of 3, a third dataset (semi-structured) will be required.
2. Datasets must be programmatically stored in appropriate database(s) prior to processing.
